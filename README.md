Ayana Tran  

I'm an undergraduate in my junior year, pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in CS. My favorite things are solving problems, making things efficient, and learning from other people. My long-term goal is to become a competent and reliable software engineer. One funny thing about me is that I love singing Japanese songs, but I don't understand the language so I use Romanji and the sound of the singer's pronunciations to learn the song.
